# 47-Home-Loan-Project-Demo-Practice
Follow the below steps:
First Send me your UserNames to add as Collaborators to this Project
Fork this project in your Github Repository (There is option right side , just click on it)
After fork in your Github , Clone this Repository in your local disk / Laptop (use command - git clone url)
Then Run this Project using Spring , perform changes according to your Spring Tool Suite Version 
Create POJO classes (Using Lombok - add both type of constructors also) (This is your main TASK)
After completing your task, Right click on your project and go to Show in Local  Terminal --> Git Bash , and a Git Bash Terminal will open in Your Spring Boot Console
After that initialize git in that  local path using command git init (if not initialized ---> if .git folder is not shows in Hidden Folder)
After that , add your Task files, Only Task Files, Not Entire Project, use command git add File_Name (Do not use git add . -- It will replace currunt project files to  new files after that project will not RUN)
After adding your Task files, commit changes in All Files, About what you are going to perform
After commit once check  all thet files are in Staging Area or Not 
Then push this files into Your GitHub Repositoy (Which you will have Forked from My GitHub and Now same Repo is on your Repo) ---> Important to Understand
(Once you Fork , then Do Not play with My GitHub Projcet ---> Commit changes on your GitHub only)
After that add origin, using command - git remote add origin url (Here url is your Github Project Repo)
After that push your files in that repo using command - git push -u origin master (here master is your branch)
Important note --> Change your Branch name to your names , and do not perform any opration on Master or Main Branch, Do this all task on new Branch and then merge if needed
After that check your GitHub Repo , If all tasks are done..
Then you have to create pull request (also commit particular to that ) and I will check and merge them to my or our Main Project which is in my Local disk / Laptop
Finally All Tasks Will Done....
If anyone did not understand then just create POJO class (Using Lombok - add both type of constructors also) in your Spring Boot without Git or GitHub , I will explain you tomorrow, But create POJO classes (Using Lombok - add both type of constructors also)-- This is mandatory
